## 📝 Writing Tips for Report

### Introduction (1-2 pages)
- Brief overview of Marina Travel
- Project objectives
- Technology stack summary
- Report structure

### For Each Learning Outcome:
1. **State the requirement** (P1, M1, D1, etc.)
2. **Explain your approach** (what you did)
3. **Provide evidence** (code snippets, screenshots, diagrams)
4. **Analyze/justify** (why you did it this way)
5. **Show results** (what was achieved)

### Use Evidence:
- Code snippets (keep them short, 10-15 lines max)
- Screenshots of website sections
- Diagrams (architecture, data flow)
- Test results tables
- Performance metrics
- Wireframes

### Professional Language:
- ✅ "The React framework was chosen because..."
- ✅ "This implementation demonstrates..."
- ✅ "Analysis reveals that..."
- ❌ Avoid: "I think...", "I feel..."
- Use: Third person or passive voice

### Citations:
Reference your documentation:
- "As documented in the design document..."
- "The test plan (Appendix A) shows..."
- "According to the performance analysis..."
