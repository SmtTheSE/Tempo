JavaScript enables interactive and dynamic functionality on websites. Our implementation uses TypeScript (a typed superset of JavaScript) to build interactive components with enhanced code reliability and developer experience.

When comparing online website creation tools with custom-built sites, significant differences emerge in terms of design flexibility, performance, functionality, and user experience. Online website builders like Wix, Squarespace, and WordPress offer templates and drag-and-drop interfaces that make website creation accessible to non-developers. However, these platforms often impose limitations on customization and may include branding or advertisements.

Custom-built websites, like our Ocean Adventures project, provide unlimited design flexibility and precise control over every aspect of the user interface. We implemented an Apple-inspired design aesthetic with clean lines, ample white space, and high-quality imagery, which would be difficult to achieve with template-based tools. Custom development allows for tailored responsive behavior, optimized performance, and integration with specialized third-party services like Supabase for backend functionality.

In terms of performance, custom-built sites typically outperform website builder platforms because they include only necessary code without the bloat of unused features. Our implementation uses Vite for rapid development and optimized builds, resulting in faster load times. Additionally, custom sites can be fine-tuned for search engine optimization with specific meta tags and semantic HTML structure.

Functionality-wise, custom development enables unique features that aren't available in standard website builder packages. Our contact form integrates directly with Supabase, allowing for real-time data storage and retrieval. We also implemented custom animations and interactive elements that align with our brand identity.

Regarding user experience and interface design, custom sites can be crafted specifically for the target audience's needs. We designed our navigation system to be intuitive and consistent across all pages, with careful attention to typography using the San Francisco font stack and appropriate color contrast for accessibility. The responsive design adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework for creating responsive websites. While we opted for Tailwind CSS for this project, Bootstrap offers similar capabilities for responsive design with its grid system and pre-built components.
